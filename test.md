# this is a test (markdown) file

congratulations.  
youâ€™ve just opened **the** most underwhelming markdown file on the internet.

yep. this is it.  
the markdown file that's gonna make or break my little go lsp.

does it do anything cool?  
not really.  
does it exist purely so i can say "look, i made a thing"?  
yeah, basically.
