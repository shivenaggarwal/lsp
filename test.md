# this is a test (markdown) file


<!-- TODO: add real content to this file -->

congratulations.  
youâ€™ve just opened **the** most underwhelming markdown file on the internet.

yep. this is it.  
the markdown file that's gonna make or break my little go lsp.

does it do anything cool?  
not really.  
does it exist purely so i can say "look, i made a thing"?  
yeah, basically.

this file has no purpose other than boosting my ego.

VS Code sucks
