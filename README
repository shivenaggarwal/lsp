# simple go lsp

a tiny language server i built to learn go and understand how editors and tools use language servers to communicate.

## what i (mostly) learned

- basic go syntax and tooling
- simple go project structure
- how json-rpc 2.0 works
- stdin/stdout communication
- handling `initialize` and `initialized` messages
- debugging lsp message flow

---

built as a learning experience, if it breaks, it's probably a feature.
